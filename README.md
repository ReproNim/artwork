# The ReproNim ***Artwork*** Repo

Art is in the eye of the beholder. We at **ReproNim** take a broad definition of 'art'. In this repo you will find 
traditional(ish) art items (like Logos and Pictures), but you will also find (or find pointers to) art-like objects such as 
Posters and Talks. All of this material is in the public domain.
